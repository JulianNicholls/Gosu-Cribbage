# Gosu-Cribbage (again)

I'm starting again with a lot more Gosu (and Ruby!) experience.
The first version stalled somewhat, and I'm going to rewrite it from scratch,
basically.

## Progress

- [x] Basic Display of Table and Cards
- [x] Initial Cut for Deal
- [x] Select Cards for Discard
- [x] CPU Selects Cards for Discard
- [x] Discard Cards to Crib
- [ ] Play up to 3 rounds to 31
- [ ] Score Hands
- [ ] Score Crib
- [ ] Start next Round
- [ ] Complete a Game to 121 points

- [ ] More Intelligence in CPU Discard
- [ ] More Intelligence in CPU Play to 31
